 * A stand-in introspector class, used only to test the extension point.
 *
 * SQLite is a supported driver now, with a real introspector, so nothing needs
 * this to make the suite run. What it still provides is an arbitrary class to
 * point `sql.introspectors` at, proving that config can register a driver the
 * package does not ship and override one it does.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT a plausible SQLite implementation — anything relying
 * on it for real introspection would be testing the wrong thing.
