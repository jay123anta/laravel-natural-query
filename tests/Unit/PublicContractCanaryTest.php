/**
 * Third-party implementations of every published contract must keep loading.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * The package's contracts are an invitation: implement LlmProviderInterface
 * and any model works, implement QueryCacheInterface and any store works.
 * That invitation is only worth something if accepting it does not break on
 * the next upgrade.
 *
 * PHP enforces interface signatures at CLASS LOAD time. Adding a parameter to
 * an interface method — even an OPTIONAL one — is a fatal error for every
 * class already implementing the old shape. Not a deprecation, not degraded
 * behaviour: the application does not boot.
 *
 * And the package's own suite is structurally blind to it, because the
 * bundled implementations get updated in the same change that moves the
 * signature. That is exactly what happened: `QueryCacheInterface::find()`
 * grew a `?string $datasetHint` parameter, both bundled caches were updated
 * alongside it, 577 tests stayed green, and every custom cache in the world
 * would have fataled on upgrade. It was caught by reading, not by running.
 *
 * The classes below are deliberately minimal and deliberately NOT updated
 * when a contract changes. They stand in for an adopter's code, frozen at the
 * signature this package published. If one stops loading, an upgrade breaks
 * somebody, and the test says so in the same run that broke it.
 *
 * WHEN THIS TEST FAILS, the fix is usually NOT to update the class here —
 * that just re-hides the break. It is to keep the contract stable and put the
 * new capability in a separate optional interface, the way `ReportsUsage` and
 * `ScopesCacheByDataset` both do.
