/**
 * What a follow-up is allowed to change.
 *
 * "Only in Guwahati" narrows. It does not choose a new measure and it does not
 * choose a new breakdown, so an intent that comes back with different ones has
 * re-guessed rather than answered — and merging those silently swaps the
 * question out from under the user.
 *
 * A weaker model on Groq did exactly that: after "total amount by city", the
 * narrowing turn returned record_count by client, and the answer counted
 * invoices per client while the screen said amounts per city. Stronger models
 * carry state without being told; guarding it here is what makes conversations
 * work on the small open-weight models this package is meant to run on, where
 * that inference is precisely what is missing.
