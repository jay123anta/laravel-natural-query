     * value in the query it would send, defended on the grounds that clicking
     * makes it the user's own text. On a freshly discovered schema the top
     * row's value can be a `remember_token` — introspection marks every string
     * column groupable and nothing here knows which ones hold secrets. It was
     * gated by `chat.suggest_drilldown_values`, which is exactly the
     * "rejected by configuration" that Rule 2 forbids.

     * suggestion by ANY route, this fails and names the field it came out of.
