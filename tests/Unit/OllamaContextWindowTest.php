/**
 * The context window Ollama is told to use, and what happens when a prompt
 * will not fit inside it.
 *
 * The driver set `num_predict` — how many tokens to write — and never
 * `num_ctx`, how many it may read. So every install ran on Ollama's server
 * default, which is 4096 in current builds and 2048 in older ones, and neither
 * is a number this package chose or documented.
 *
 * Ollama does not reject a prompt that exceeds it. It silently discards the
 * beginning and answers from what is left. The schema block is at the top, so
 * what gets thrown away is the table definitions, and what survives is the
 * question — producing a confident answer built on a schema the model never
 * fully saw.
 *
 * The measured prompt for a twelve-table, fourteen-column app is about 4,285
 * tokens. That is a small Laravel application, already over the default, on
 * exactly the local-first stack this package exists to serve.
 *
 * These pin the wire shape and the refusal, not the answer — a canned response
 * is perfectly happy to reply to a prompt the model only half received.
