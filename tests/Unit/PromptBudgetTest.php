/**
 * NQ-001-REDUCE, RED for G2.
 *
 * The G1-round-3 ruling cuts PromptBudget down to the bare bound: a PURE
 * function of a finished prompt string and how many datasets were actually
 * RENDERED into it -  `check(string $prompt, int $datasetsRendered): ?string`.
 * No `PromptScope` argument, no scoping knowledge at all.
 *
 * Today's `PromptBudget::check()` still requires a `PromptScope` as its
 * second argument (src/Engine/PromptBudget.php:35), so every test below that
 * calls `check($prompt, <int>)` fails RIGHT NOW with a TypeError -  the
 * reduction has not happened yet. That is the correct RED failure: it proves
 * the bare-bound signature does not exist, not that arithmetic is wrong.
 *
 * WHAT WRONG BEHAVIOUR THIS FILE CATCHES, once the signature exists:
 *
 * 1. `the_boundary_is_exact` -  a size-refusal that is off by even one
 *    character either lets an over-budget prompt through (a provider call
 *    that predictably fails, or worse, a truncated schema silently
 *    answered -  the OllamaProvider failure mode) or refuses a prompt that
 *    would have fit, for no reason a user can see.
 *
 * 2. `the_refusal_names_bytes_needed_bytes_allowed_and_the_config_lever` -
 *    a refusal that does not name the actual lever
 *    (`naturalquery.prompts.max_chars`) sends an adopter guessing at which
 *    of a dozen config keys to change, which is indistinguishable from "could
 *    not understand the query" in practice even though the cause here is
 *    entirely mechanical and fixable in one edit.
 *
 * 3. `a_single_rendered_dataset_is_never_told_to_narrow_to_fewer_datasets` -
 *    THE defect the ruling names by name: "note the current implementation
 *    picks that wording from scope key count, which is not what was
 *    rendered. That incoherence must not survive." The OLD code
 *    (src/Engine/PromptBudget.php:51) chose this sentence from
 *    `count($scope->keys())` -  the SEEDED/EXPANDED scope -  which is not the
 *    same number as how many datasets actually went into the prompt string
 *    (a single-dataset `buildSqlPrompt()` call renders exactly one schema
 *    section regardless of how many keys the scope object carried). Telling
 *    someone asking a single-dataset question to "narrow to fewer datasets"
 *    is nonsense advice that sends them looking for a lever that cannot
 *    help. The reduced design closes the gap structurally: the caller must
 *    pass the actual rendered count, so there is no second number left to
 *    disagree with it.
 *
 * 4. `multiple_rendered_datasets_are_offered_the_narrowing_lever` -  the
 *    mirror image: when more than one dataset really was rendered, dropping
 *    the narrowing advice entirely would leave a genuinely fixable question
 *    ("ask about one topic at a time") with no actionable lever at all,
 *    which is exactly as unhelpful as offering it wrongly.
 *
 * 5. `an_unbounded_budget_never_refuses` -  baseline (C1): `max_chars = null`
 *    must never refuse, at any size or dataset count, or a fresh install
 *    with the feature untouched starts failing questions that worked in
 *    v2.0.0.
