     *      counted three datasets where it expected two.
     *   2. A published config/naturalquery.php sat in the skeleton and SHADOWED
     *      the package config for the entire suite. Every test after it ran
     *      against a stale snapshot -  which is how a changed middleware default
     *      went unnoticed until a test asserted on it directly.
     *
     * The second is the dangerous kind: nothing failed, the suite just stopped
     * testing the current code. So the installer runs against a temp schema
     * directory, and anything else it creates is recorded and deleted.
