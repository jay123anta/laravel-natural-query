/**
 * FROM is not always a table reference.
 *
 * `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)` is ordinary SQL and the obvious way to filter
 * by year -  and the table extractor read `order_date` as a table, so the query
 * was refused with "Unauthorized table: order_date". A column name, reported as
 * an unauthorised table, on a question as plain as "total revenue this year".
 *
 * Found by running the planner against a live model for the first time: both
 * steps of "revenue this year versus last year" failed, and the multi-step
 * answer said only that none of its steps could be answered.
 *
 * The failure was safe -  valid SQL refused, never invalid SQL admitted -  but it
 * made a common question impossible and the message pointed nowhere.
