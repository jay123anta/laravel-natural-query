/**
 * Both methods that refuse must SAY they refused.
 *
 * `willNotFit()` guards two call sites — generateSql() and parseIntent(). The
 * NQ-002 fix taught the orchestrator not to retry a refusal that never reached
 * the wire, keyed on a `refused_before_sending` flag, and set that flag in
 * generateSql(). parseIntent() was left returning a bare errorResponse().
 *
 * So an intent-mode context refusal still looked, to the orchestrator, exactly
 * like a model that answered badly — and the answer to a model that answered
 * badly is retryWithRefinedPrompt(), which sends a SMALLER single-dataset
 * prompt. That prompt clears the same guard, gets answered, and the refusal the
 * user should have seen becomes a confident number from one table.
 *
 * Which is precisely the defect NQ-002 was written to close, surviving on the
 * call site NQ-002 did not visit. Three independent reviewers found it.
 *
 * The lesson is structural rather than local: the flag belongs to the REFUSAL,
 * not to the method that happens to produce it. A guard attached per-call-site
 * gives every future call site a fresh chance to forget.
