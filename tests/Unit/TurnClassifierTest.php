/**
 * What kind of turn is this?
 *
 * The distinction is not cosmetic. A drill-down changes only the breakdown and
 * leaves everything else standing; a refinement merges whatever the model
 * re-read from the sentence, which means a re-guessed measure can overwrite the
 * one already established. Getting the label wrong therefore risks getting the
 * answer wrong, not just the badge.
 *
 * Found in a browser: "total amount by city" then "breakdown by client" was
 * reported as a refinement. Nothing had been narrowed — the totals matched at
 * 12,100 — and the sentence is plainly a drill-down. The cause was one space:
 * every drill pattern read `break\s+…`, so the one-word spelling people
 * actually type fell through to the refinement default.
