/**
 * NQ-001-REDUCE trimmed this to `detect()` alone. `seeds()` and its three
 * per-signal helpers existed only to feed `SchemaShortlister`, the
 * scope-narrowing half of NQ-001-v2 the G1-round-3 ruling struck out
 * entirely, and were deleted with it.
 *
 * `detect()` is load-bearing on its own: `QueryOrchestrator::
 * resolveAskingDataset()` calls it, and that is what stops the NQ-003 cache
 * fix from replaying one dataset's cached answer for another (see
 * `tests/Feature/FuzzyCacheDatasetIsolationTest.php`).
 *
 * Fixture reused from `tests/Stubs/related-schemas` -  it was not written for
 * this test, but its two aliased, unrelated datasets (rel_orders / "orders",
 * rel_customers / "customers") are exactly the shape `detect()` needs.
