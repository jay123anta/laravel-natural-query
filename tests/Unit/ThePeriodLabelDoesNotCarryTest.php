/**
 * A label describing ONE answer must not become an instruction for the next.
 *
 * The period reaches `summary()` as a rendered label — "July 2026" — not as a
 * range. Two labels cannot be intersected the way two dates can, so carrying
 * one forward re-applies a window the next question never asked for.
 *
 * The first attempt made it a slot and excluded it inside `merge()` and
 * `toIntent()`. That was wrong in BOTH directions at once, which is why this
 * file tests both:
 *
 *  - It still carried. `merge()` begins by copying every slot and only
 *    ITERATES the carrying list, and `drillDown()` and `withoutFilters()` copy
 *    the slots too and were never touched. Measured cost: "total revenue in
 *    July" then "only in West" answered 600 — West all-time — under the
 *    heading "July 2026", when West in July is 100.
 *  - And it was destroyed. `StateValidator` rebuilds the state from
 *    `toIntent()`, so on the conversation route the label never survived to
 *    reach `state_summary` at all, and the widget prefers `state_summary`.
 *
 * It is no longer a slot. Nothing that copies slots can move it, and nothing
 * that rebuilds from slots can lose it. These tests pin that property rather
 * than the four call sites that used to have to remember it.
