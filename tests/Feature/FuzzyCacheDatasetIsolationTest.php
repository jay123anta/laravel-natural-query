/**
 * NQ-003, RED for G2.
 *
 * `TwoTierQueryCache::find(string $query)` (src/Cache/TwoTierQueryCache.php)
 * takes ONLY the normalized question text. Nothing about which dataset the
 * ASKING question resolves to is ever consulted before a cached row is
 * served, on any of its routes:
 *
 *   - Tier 1 (fast KV store): keyed by `sha256(CONTRACT_VERSION . normalized
 *     text)`. `$datasetHint` -  the out-of-band signal a caller can supply
 *     (`QueryOrchestrator::query($q, $datasetHint)`; a widget embedded on a
 *     page already scoped to one dataset is the real-world source) -  is
 *     never part of the hash and is never even passed to `find()`.
 *   - Tier 2 exact: same hash, same gap.
 *   - Tier 2 fuzzy (`findFuzzyMatch()`): selects candidates by `LIKE` on
 *     significant words and ranks by `calculateSimilarity()` against
 *     `cache.similarity_threshold`. The `dataset` column the row already
 *     stores is never read.
 *
 * All three feed the SAME cached branch in
 * `QueryOrchestrator::processWithSqlGeneration()` -  `if ($cached &&
 * isset($cached['intent']['_sql_result'])) { return
 * $this->validateAndExecute($sqlResult, ...); }` -  which returns before any
 * prompt is built and before dataset detection (seeder/routing/LLM) ever
 * runs. That is the ONLY place a wrong-dataset SQL result could otherwise be
 * caught, so a cache hit that crosses datasets is never caught downstream
 * either.
 *
 * Routes enumerated and checked in this file:
 *   - Tier 2 fuzzy, different wording, no dataset hint  → test (a)
 *   - Tier 2 fuzzy, SAME dataset (must keep working)     → test (b)
 *   - Tier 1 exact, identical wording, changed dataset hint → test (c)
 * NQ-003-FIX: both (a) and (c) were rewritten, because NQ-003's own fix for
 * this file's original defect was itself unsafe -  a silent retarget through
 * `SqlBuilder` rather than a refusal -  and the `_sql_result` branch that
 * retarget lived in does not distinguish Tier 1 exact from Tier 2 fuzzy; it
 * runs identically for both. (a) -  `a_fuzzy_hit_must_not_replay_a_different_datasets_answer`
 * -  kept its name (still true: a mismatch no longer replays anything) but its
 * body now expects a MISS, the same change made to (c) -
 * `an_exact_tier1_candidate_with_a_changed_dataset_hint_is_a_cache_miss`,
 * formerly `an_exact_tier1_hit_must_not_ignore_a_changed_dataset_hint`. See
 * each test's docblock and `tests/Feature/CacheDatasetMismatchMissTest.php`.
 * NOT covered here: the conversation-turn path. `processWithIntent()`
 * explicitly disables cache USE while `$context['state']` is non-empty
 * (`if ($cached && !$inConversation)`), but `processWithSqlGeneration()`'s
 * `_sql_result` branch has no equivalent guard -  a follow-up could hit this
 * same gap. Left for the Adversarial Reviewer: it is the same structural
 * defect as (a)/(c) above, not a fourth mechanism, so a fix that makes
 * `find()`/the `_sql_result` branch itself dataset-aware closes it too; a
 * fix that only special-cases `findFuzzyMatch()` would not.
 *
 * No scoping feature is involved anywhere below. NQ-001-v2's per-question
 * dataset scoping (`PromptScope`, `SchemaShortlister`, `QueryOrchestrator::
 * resolveScope()`) was removed outright by NQ-001-REDUCE -  the G1-round-3
 * ruling struck it out entirely, keeping only `PromptBudget`'s bare
 * `prompts.max_chars` size refusal. An earlier revision of that now-deleted
 * scoping feature happened to catch this exact cross-dataset scenario as a
 * SIDE EFFECT when it was turned on, in what was then `PromptScopeGateTest`
 * (also since removed) -  which passed for that reason, not because the
 * cache itself was fixed. This file proves the cache is broken on its own,
 * with nothing else involved.

     * (zero extra provider calls) onto the right number, because in this
     * predicate-free fixture `SqlBuilder::buildQuery()`'s retarget happens to

     * shows dropping a WHERE clause elsewhere -  the `_sql_result` branch does
     * not know it is looking at a fuzzy candidate rather than an exact one,
