/**
 * A rule the schema cannot imply must hold on BOTH routes.
 *
 * `required_filter` is how an adopter states something introspection can never
 * recover: cancelled orders never count towards a total. Nothing in the column
 * types, names or foreign keys says so.
 *
 * It was enforced on one route and requested on the other. Intent mode appends
 * it to the SQL in SqlBuilder, so the model cannot omit it. SQL generation put
 * a line in the prompt and hoped. A model that ignored it produced a total
 * including every cancelled order, reported success, and nothing downstream
 * re-checked. The check now sits where SQL executes, so both routes are held
 * to it.
 *
 * That check is a LITERAL string match, and it has to stay one: it decides
 * whether rows the schema says must never be counted were excluded, so a loose
 * match that accepted an equivalent-looking predicate would be guessing about
 * the one thing nobody may guess about. Failing closed has a cost - a model
 * writing `status NOT IN ('cancelled')` against a rule written
 * `status != 'cancelled'` is refused, correct SQL and all - so the PROMPT is
 * what gives: it asks for the predicate character for character. Loosening the
 * guard to meet the model would trade a refusal for a wrong number.
 *
 * That is the shape of every defect this release has fixed: a guarantee that
 * holds on the path it was written for and not the one beside it. And it is
 * worse here than most, because the whole point of the setting is that the
 * answer is WRONG without it -  a user who writes the rule has been told the
 * package will apply it.
 *
 * Fixture: 100 paid + 200 paid + 500 cancelled. The rule makes the answer 300;
 * without it, 800.
