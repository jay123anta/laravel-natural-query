 * The rename itself is mechanical and the suite covers it by construction —
 * every fixture was renamed alongside the code, which is exactly why a green
 * suite proves nothing here. What a rename actually breaks is the data written
 * by the previous version: a column that still has the old name, and a cached
 * JSON blob that still has the old key inside it.
 *
 * These build 1.0.0-shaped rows deliberately and then upgrade them.
