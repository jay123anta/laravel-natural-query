/**
 * A rule that holds on the paths someone remembered is not enforced.
 *
 * `required_filter` was checked at the two sites where SQL is GENERATED. SQL
 * reaches the database by more routes than that, and each missed one is a
 * silent wrong number -  the exact failure the setting exists to prevent:
 *
 *  1. QueryVerifier rewrites `sql` AFTER the check, and its fix is trusted
 *     without re-verification (`reverify_fixes` defaults to false), so a
 *     rewrite that drops the filter executes unchallenged. Verification is ON
 *     by default.
 *  2. That rewritten SQL is then stored as the `_sql_result` cache recipe, and
 *     the replay branch hands it to the executor with no guard at all. Tier 2
 *     rows never expire, so one bad row answers that question forever.
 *  3. The check was keyed on the dataset the MODEL reported, so a mislabelled
 *     or absent `dataset` disarmed it completely.
 *
 * This is the pattern the project keeps producing -  a guard attached to call
 * sites rather than to the thing guarded -  so the check now sits at the single
 * point where SQL executes, and is keyed on the tables the SQL actually names.
 *
 * Fixture: 100 paid + 200 paid + 500 cancelled. The rule makes the answer 300;
 * without it, 800.
