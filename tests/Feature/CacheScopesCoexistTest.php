/**
 * Refusing to SHARE a row between scopes is right. Refusing to STORE both is
 * not, and that is what shipped.
 *
 * `query_hash` is UNIQUE and derived from the question's text alone, so there
 * is exactly one row per wording. store() finds that row and updates it. Two
 * dataset-scoped pages asking the same words therefore take turns overwriting
 * each other:
 *
 *   orders page asks   -> row scope=orders
 *   products page asks -> scope mismatch, miss, regenerate, UPDATE row to products
 *   orders page asks   -> scope mismatch, miss, regenerate, UPDATE row to orders
 *
 * Neither page ever gets a hit, forever, and each pays an API call every time.
 * The cache is not merely conservative here -  it is 0% for any wording used on
 * more than one scoped page, which on a multi-tenant or multi-page install is
 * the normal case rather than an edge one.
 *
 * The scope belongs in the key. It is already in the hash's other dimension -
 * `generateHash()` folds in the contract version for exactly this reason -  so
 * a scoped question and an unscoped one simply address different rows.
 *
 * (#11) And in the shipped default `auto` mode, a question whose cached row
 * carries a finished SQL recipe was still routed to intent mode first, which
 * cannot use that shape and calls parseIntent before falling back to the
 * reader that can. Every repeat paid for a provider call whose result was then
 * discarded in favour of the cached SQL.
