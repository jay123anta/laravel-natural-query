/**
 * NQ-003-FIX, RED for G2.
 *
 * NQ-003 stopped the cache replaying one dataset's cached answer for a
 * question about another, but the mechanism it used to do that was
 * RECONCILIATION, not refusal: on a dataset mismatch,
 * `QueryOrchestrator::processWithSqlGeneration()`'s `_sql_result` branch
 * retargets the cached recipe through `SqlBuilder::buildQuery()` for the
 * newly-asked dataset, and `processWithIntent()` silently overwrites
 * `$intent['dataset']` with whatever `resolveAskingDataset()` says. Both
 * are zero-API-call "fixes" that can produce a confidently wrong answer:
 *
 *   - BLOCKER A: `SqlBuilder::buildQuery()` rebuilds from the cached
 *     recipe's `metric`/`group_value`/`limit`/`order`/`query_type` alone.
 *     A predicate the intent contract cannot express — a HAVING, a numeric
 *     comparison, anything that only exists in the raw SQL text the model
 *     originally wrote — has nowhere to ride along, so it is silently
 *     dropped and `buildQuery()` reports success anyway: a filtered
 *     question is answered UNFILTERED, on a different table.
 *   - BLOCKER B: `resolveAskingDataset()` falls back to
 *     `DatasetSeeder::detect()`, a bare keyword guess, whenever no
 *     `$datasetHint` and no conversation state are available. On a cache
 *     hit that guess OVERWRITES the dataset the model itself parsed the
 *     first time, so an identical repeat of a question can be answered
 *     from a different table than the first time purely because the
 *     keyword guess disagrees with what the model said.
 *
 * NQ-003-FIX deletes both reconciliation paths. A dataset mismatch is now
 * a cache MISS: one more provider call, never a silent retarget or
 * override. This file is written BEFORE that deletion and must fail
 * against the code as it stands today — see each test's docblock for the
 * specific mechanism it exercises and why it is red right now.
 *
 * `tests/Feature/FuzzyCacheDatasetIsolationTest::
 * an_exact_tier1_hit_must_not_ignore_a_changed_dataset_hint` (now renamed
 * `an_exact_tier1_candidate_with_a_changed_dataset_hint_is_a_cache_miss`)
 * covers the same mechanism as this file's first test, in the other
 * direction (nq_orders asked first, nq_products second) — deliberately
 * kept in that file since it already owned the Tier 1 route; this file
 * covers everything else NQ-003-FIX's own defect report calls out by name.
