/**
 * The staleness guard, on the route where the dates are invisible.
 *
 * `sql_generation` caches the model's finished SQL, so "revenue last month"
 * bakes that month in as literals. The first guard against this read
 * `time_filter`, which on this route is `$data['period']` - what the model
 * SAYS about the WHERE it wrote, in an optional free-text field.
 *
 * That failed in both directions at once. A model that filtered dates and
 * omitted the field disarmed the guard completely, so the June window was
 * cached and replayed into August - the exact defect the guard exists to
 * prevent, alive on the other route. And a model that answered "none" instead
 * of a null armed it on every question, switching caching off entirely with
 * nothing logged.
 *
 * Neither was covered: deleting the whole branch left the suite green.
 *
 * The guard now reads the SQL. Fixture `ps_orders`: June 2026 = 300, July
 * 2026 = 700, so a stale window cannot pass by coincidence.
