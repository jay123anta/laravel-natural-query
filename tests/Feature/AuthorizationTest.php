/**
 * Who may spend the API key.
 *
 * The package used to put `auth` in the default middleware — right instinct,
 * wrong mechanism. A fresh `laravel new` app has no auth scaffolding and so no
 * `login` route, and the first thing a new adopter met was not a login page but
 *
 *     RouteNotFoundException: Route [login] not defined
 *
 * a 500 on `/naturalquery/demo`, the page the README tells them to visit.
 * Confirmed on a virgin Laravel 13 install before this was changed.
 *
 * A gate replaces it, the way Telescope and Horizon solve the same problem.
 * These cases hold both halves: usable the moment it is installed, and shut
 * everywhere it should be. The second half matters more — these endpoints spend
 * money on every request, so an open one in production is an LLM proxy for the
 * internet.
