/**
 * `state_summary` and `parsed_summary` describe the same answer, so they agree.
 *
 * The widget renders `data.state_summary || data.parsed_summary`, so whichever
 * is present is THE explanation of the number on screen — and inside a
 * conversation that is always `state_summary`. They are built from different
 * objects, and every time they have drifted the user has been shown the
 * weaker one:
 *
 *  - First, one named a breakdown and the other did not, because `parsed_query`
 *    reported the schema's default dimension while the summary reported none.
 *  - Then the period appeared on `parsed_summary` and never on `state_summary`,
 *    because the label was made a state slot and `StateValidator` rebuilds the
 *    state from `toIntent()`, destroying it on every turn. A month's total and
 *    an all-time total once again read identically, with the correct line
 *    present in the same payload and unused.
 *
 * A shared builder was never what prevented drift. Feeding it the same values
 * is, and asserting both lines is how that stays true.
 *
 * Fixture `ul_sales`: schema default group column `customer_name`, which is
 * deliberately NOT what these queries group by. Acme/West/pending/100 and
 * Beta/East/pending/200, both dated July 2026.
