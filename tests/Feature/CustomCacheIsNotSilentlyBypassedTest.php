/**
 * Two ways an adopter's cache stopped being called, both silent.
 *
 * A. A CUSTOM QueryCacheInterface IS NEVER READ.
 * findInCache() used to return null outright — bypassing the cache — whenever
 * an asking dataset was known and the cache did not implement
 * ScopesCacheByDataset. resolveAskingDataset() returns the sole key
 * unconditionally on a single-dataset install, which is the common shape, so
 * the bypass fired on every question. store() still ran, so the table filled
 * up and the hit count stayed at zero: the cache looked installed and did
 * nothing.
 *
 * The bypass existed because a cache that cannot filter by dataset might
 * return a row from the wrong one. That reason has since gone: eligibility is
 * decided in query() against `_asking_scope`, which travels inside the intent
 * blob every cache already stores and returns. The guard is universal, so the
 * bypass is redundant.
 *
 * B. A SUBCLASS THAT OVERRIDES find() IS SKIPPED.
 * Overriding find() on the bundled cache is the natural way to add a tenant or
 * permission gate. But TwoTierQueryCache implements ScopesCacheByDataset, the
 * subclass inherits that, and the engine therefore calls findForDataset() —
 * which does not go through find(). The gate never runs and nothing says so.
 * On a multi-tenant install that is a cross-tenant read.
 *
 * A subclass in that shape now gets find() called, so its override is
 * honoured. The cost is the fuzzy tier, which needs the scope the other method
 * carries; losing a fuzzy hit costs one API call, and honouring the gate is
 * not optional.
