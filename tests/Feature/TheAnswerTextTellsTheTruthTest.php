/**
 * The sentence a user reads, and hears, must be as true as the number.
 *
 * `parsed_summary` was made honest first, and that left a worse state than
 * before: the caption fell silent about the breakdown while the ANSWER
 * SENTENCE went on asserting one. A reader who checks the line under the
 * number finds nothing, and believes the headline.
 *
 * Four defects, all of which produced a confident false statement with
 * `status: success`, and none of which any of the 699 existing tests could
 * see.
 *
 * Fixture `ul_sales`, hand-checked:
 *   Acme/West/pending/2026-07-05/100, Beta/East/pending/2026-07-06/200,
 *   Acme/West/cancelled/2025-01-06/500
 *   all time 800, West 600, East 200. Schema default group column is
 *   `customer_name`, deliberately not what these queries group by.
