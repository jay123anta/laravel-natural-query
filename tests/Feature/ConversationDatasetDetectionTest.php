/**
 * The package has to work against any application's database, so nothing in it
 * may assume a particular domain.
 *
 * Deciding whether a short utterance names a DIFFERENT dataset — and so starts
 * a new question — or is a value to filter the current one by used to match a
 * hardcoded list of dataset names from the project this package was extracted
 * from. On every other application that list matched nothing, so short
 * follow-ups were always treated as record lookups, and an unrelated app that
 * happened to mention one of those words was told it had switched dataset.
 *
 * The decision now belongs to TurnClassifier, and it asks the registry. These
 * cases run against the test schemas (test_orders, test_districts), which share
 * no vocabulary with that list.
