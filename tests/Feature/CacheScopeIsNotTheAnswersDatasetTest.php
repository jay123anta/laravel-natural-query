/**
 * One column was doing two incompatible jobs.
 *
 * `dataset` holds the dataset the ANSWER turned out to be about -  the one the
 * model chose -  and naturalquery:cache-cleanup --dataset and the stats command
 * both read it that way. The dataset-isolation fix then reused it for
 * something else: deciding whether a row is eligible to answer THIS question,
 * by comparing it against what the asker's scope resolves to.
 *
 * Those are different values and conflating them broke both jobs.
 *
 * COST. An unhinted question on a multi-dataset install resolves to no asking
 * scope -  resolveAskingDataset() returns null once keyword detection fails and
 * more than one dataset is registered. Its own cached row carries the dataset
 * the model picked, which is never null. So the row mismatches the very
 * question that created it, every repeat pays for a fresh API call, and the
 * cache is off for exactly the questions users repeat most. That was a
 * regression introduced by the isolation fix, not a pre-existing defect.
 *
 * STALENESS. store()'s update branch rewrites `intent` and `contract_version`
 * and nothing else, so once the same wording is asked about a second dataset
 * the column keeps the first answer's value forever. cache-cleanup --dataset
 * then deletes nothing and the documented remedy for a stale answer silently
 * does not work.
 *
 * The fix records the asker's SCOPE separately, in the intent blob under
 * `_asking_scope` -  no new column, and no change to QueryCacheInterface, which
 * a previous attempt broke for every third-party implementor by adding a
 * parameter. `dataset` goes back to meaning the answer's dataset, and is now
 * kept current on update.
