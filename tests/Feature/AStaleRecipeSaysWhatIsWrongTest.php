/**
 * A refusal must name the thing that is actually broken.
 *
 * An adopter renames a table and updates their schema file. A recipe cached
 * under the old name is replayed, the validator refuses it against the
 * schema-derived whitelist - correctly, and with a message that says exactly
 * that - and the message was then thrown away and replaced with:
 *
 *   "Could not understand the query. Try mentioning a dataset name.
 *    Available: Test Orders (test_orders), Test Districts (test_districts)"
 *
 * The question was read perfectly. The dataset IS named. Following the advice
 * cannot work, and the real cause - a stale cache row naming a table that no
 * longer exists - is invisible. Rows carry no expiry, so it says this for ever
 * at zero provider calls, which is the shape Rule 0 names by name.
 *
 * The replacement happens in retryWithRefinedPrompt, and only AFTER its
 * regeneration strategy has declined, so nothing here weakens that recovery.
