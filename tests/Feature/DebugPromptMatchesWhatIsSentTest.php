/**
 * `naturalquery:debug` says it shows "EXACTLY what prompt the AI receives".
 *
 * It decided three things differently from the engine, and the whole value of
 * the command is that it decides them the same way. Someone reaches for it
 * precisely when a question is behaving oddly, so a debugger that quietly
 * models a different code path sends them looking in the wrong place.
 *
 * 1. DATASET DETECTION. The command open-coded its own str_contains() loop
 *    over keys and aliases instead of calling DatasetSeeder::detect(), which
 *    is what the engine uses and which also consults query_routing rules.
 *
 * 2. WHICH PROMPT GETS BUILT. The engine sends the MULTI-dataset prompt
 *    whenever schemas are linked, even with a dataset detected, because a
 *    question can legitimately span them and only that prompt permits a join.
 *    The command omitted the linked-schemas condition and printed the focused
 *    single-dataset prompt — the one the engine would not have sent.
 *
 * 3. THE SIZE BOUND. prompts.max_chars refuses a prompt before it is sent.
 *    The command printed the prompt with no indication that this question
 *    would be refused rather than answered.
