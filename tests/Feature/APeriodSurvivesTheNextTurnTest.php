/**
 * A period established in one turn still applies to the next.
 *
 * "Revenue in July" then "only in West" must answer West IN JULY. It answered
 * West all-time, and nothing in the response said the period had gone.
 *
 * The slots exist and `merge()` carries them: `date_from` and `date_to` are in
 * QueryState::SLOTS and always have been. The break is the FEED.
 * `ConversationManager::advance()` builds the next state from
 * `$result['parsed_query']`, and `parsed_query` carries only a rendered
 * `period` label - "2026-07-01 to 2026-07-31" - never the two dates. So
 * `fromIntent()` reads null for both on every turn, and no conversation has
 * ever held a date range.
 *
 * This is why a unit test on QueryState could not see it, and one existed:
 * it built the state by hand with dates the engine never supplies. The class
 * was never the problem.
 *
 * Fixture `ps_orders`, hand-checked:
 *   West/2026-07-05/100, East/2026-07-06/200, West/2025-01-06/500
 *   July 2026 = 300 · West all-time = 600 · West in July = 100
 * Three distinct numbers, so a dropped period cannot pass by coincidence.
