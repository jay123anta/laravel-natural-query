/**
 * A dataset mismatch is a MISS, and must be reported as one.
 *
 * NQ-003-FIX made a cached entry belonging to a different dataset fall
 * through to fresh generation instead of being retargeted. Correct. But
 * `metadata['cache_hit']` is set the moment the cache returns ANYTHING, before
 * anything downstream decides whether that entry is usable — so the fall-through
 * left the flag reading true for a question that in fact went to the provider.
 *
 * Two consequences, one cosmetic and one not:
 *
 *   The response tells an operator the answer came from cache when it did not.
 *
 *   QueryVerifier is SKIPPED. `verification.skip_on_cache_hit` defaults to true
 *   and is read straight off that flag, so the self-check on generated SQL is
 *   disabled for exactly the SQL that was just generated. A cached result was
 *   verified when it was first stored; freshly generated SQL has not been, and
 *   this is the one path where the flag says otherwise.
 *
 * That is the same shape as every other defect this release: a guard that holds
 * on the path it was written for and not on the one added beside it.
