/**
 * A decomposed question inside a conversation is still inside the conversation.
 *
 * runSteps() re-enters query() as `$this->query($question, $datasetHint)` -
 * no third argument -  so the conversation context is dropped at the door.
 * Two consequences, and the second is the one that outlives the request.
 *
 * The steps cannot see the conversation. A follow-up like "compare those two
 * regions" is decomposed into sub-questions that are then answered with no
 * knowledge of the metric, period or filters established in earlier turns.
 *
 * And every step WRITES to the query cache. The guard added in this release -
 * "a conversation turn is neither read from nor written to this cache" -  is
 * keyed on `!empty($context['state'])`, and with the context gone each step
 * looks like an ordinary standalone question. The cache key is the question's
 * text and carries no session, so a row written by one conversation's step is
 * read back by every other session that asks those words. docs/CONVERSATIONS.md
 * promises the opposite in as many words.
 *
 * It is the write, not the read, that does the damage: the row outlives the
 * conversation that created it.
