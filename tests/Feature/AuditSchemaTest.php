 * questions land near-perfectly once a handful of sentences are written. Until
 * now an adopter had no way to see WHICH sentences were missing -  "it gets
 * things wrong sometimes" is not something anyone can act on.
 *
 * Everything this reports is something introspection genuinely cannot recover.
 * Two columns called `amount`, in two tables, are identical in name, type and
 * nullability; only a person knows which one the business calls revenue.
