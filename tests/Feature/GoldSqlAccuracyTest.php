/**
 * Execution accuracy against gold SQL.
 *
 * This is how text-to-SQL is graded internationally (Spider, BIRD): you do not
 * compare query strings, because many different queries are correct. You run
 * the generated query and a hand-written reference against the same database
 * and compare the RESULT SETS. A query is right when its answer is right.
 *
 * What is measured here is deliberately narrower than a public benchmark: the
 * intent is supplied rather than parsed, so this grades SQL CONSTRUCTION, not
 * language understanding. That separation is the point. When an answer is
 * wrong, this says whether the builder or the model was at fault — and the
 * builder is the half that must never be wrong, because no amount of prompt
 * work can compensate for SQL that computes the wrong thing.
 *
 * Every case below is a claim made by the time-filter work. The gold SQL is
 * written by hand from the question, not from the implementation.
