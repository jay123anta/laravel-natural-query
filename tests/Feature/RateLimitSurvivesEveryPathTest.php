/**
 * A 429 must reach the caller as a 429, from wherever it happens.
 *
 * The package promises this in docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md — it "fails fast on 429,
 * it deliberately does not fall back or retry the whole query" — and
 * docs/API.md tells clients to branch on error_code, with rate_limited mapped
 * to HTTP 429, retryable, Retry-After set. A rate limit reported as anything
 * else is an active instruction to every SDK and queue worker NOT to back off,
 * on the one fault where backing off is the whole remedy.
 *
 * Enumerating the paths by which a provider 429 can reach the caller, because
 * fixing them one at a time is how this release has spent its entire week:
 *
 *   plan call ................. guarded (added earlier in this release)
 *   intent call ............... guarded
 *   SQL generation ............ guarded via providerFailure()
 *   refinement retry .......... guarded via providerFailure()
 *   dataset identification .... NOT GUARDED — the response was read only for
 *                               ['dataset'], so a 429 was discarded and
 *                               generateSql called immediately afterwards
 *   step loop in runSteps ..... NOT GUARDED — every step ran regardless, so
 *                               one rate limit became N more calls, and the
 *                               multi-step envelope carried no error_code at
 *                               all, so the controller produced HTTP 500 with
 *                               retryable:false
 *
 * The last two are the ones beside the one that was just fixed. Again.
