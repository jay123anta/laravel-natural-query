/**
 * A rate limit during planning must not be answered with another call.
 *
 * QueryPlanner treats its own failure as non-fatal on purpose — planning is an
 * enhancement, and a question a planner could not decompose is still a question
 * the ordinary path can answer. That is right for a malformed plan or a model
 * that returned nonsense.
 *
 * It is wrong for a 429, and the package says so in as many words:
 * docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md promises the package "fails fast on 429 — it
 * deliberately does not fall back or retry the whole query, since more calls
 * would extend the rate-limit window." On a comparison question the opposite
 * happened. Planning burned a call, hit the limit, dropped `$plan['error']`
 * without reading it, and the ordinary path immediately made another — against
 * a provider that had just said stop.
 *
 * The user then saw whatever the SECOND call produced. When that one was also
 * limited, the message was at least still about rate limiting; when it happened
 * to succeed, the comparison silently became a single-part answer.
 *
 * The planner's return had no way to say which kind of failure it was — the
 * HTTP status was dropped one level down — so the caller could not have
 * distinguished them even if it had looked.
