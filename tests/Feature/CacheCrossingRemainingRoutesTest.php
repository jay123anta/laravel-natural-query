/**
 * The two cache routes that survived the previous three fixes.
 *
 * Each earlier fix closed the route it was written for and left the one beside
 * it open. This pins both remaining ones, found by an adversarial review that
 * reproduced each with a cache-on/cache-off counterfactual rather than by
 * reading.
 *
 * ROUTE 1 -  the dataset guard is skipped when the asking dataset is unknown.
 * The discard in query() reads `$askingDataset !== null && ...`, and
 * resolveAskingDataset() returns null whenever more than one dataset is
 * registered and nothing in the question, the hint, or the conversation names
 * one. So a row cached WITH a dataset hint is served verbatim to the same
 * wording asked WITHOUT one -  which is the widget's ordinary shape: a
 * dataset-scoped page caches it, the general chat page reads it back.
 *
 * ROUTE 2 -  conversation follow-ups are cached in SQL-generation mode.
 * processWithIntent() guards its cache use with $inConversation.
 * processWithSqlGeneration()'s _sql_result branch has no equivalent, and
 * store() runs unconditionally. So a follow-up that escalates is written to a
 * TEXT-keyed cache, and another session's identically-worded follow-up reads
 * it -  carrying the first session's measure. docs/CONVERSATIONS.md states the
 * opposite in as many words.
