# Providers

Any model, hosted or your own. Business logic never references a concrete
provider, so adding one is a config block and nothing else.

## Installation

```bash
composer require jayanta/laravel-natural-query
php artisan naturalquery:install
php artisan migrate
```

Then choose a model in `.env`. **A model you run yourself is a first-class
choice, not a fallback** - the package works the same either way, and nothing
here assumes a hosted API.

```env
# Local, no API key, nothing leaves your machine
NATURALQUERY_LLM_DRIVER=ollama
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3
OLLAMA_NUM_CTX=8192
```

**`OLLAMA_NUM_CTX` matters more than it looks.** It is how many tokens the
model may read, and Ollama's own default — 4096, or 2048 on older builds — is
easily exceeded once your schema block is in the prompt.

Ollama does not reject an oversized prompt. It drops the beginning and answers
from the rest, and the beginning is your schema. The reply looks completely
normal; it was just written by a model that never saw half your tables.

NaturalQuery therefore refuses to send a prompt that will not fit, and the
error names this setting. If you hit it, either raise the value (it costs
memory, and the model has to support the size), switch to a model with a
larger context, or describe fewer tables. Values under 1024 are treated as
unset, so an empty `OLLAMA_NUM_CTX=` falls back to 8192 rather than refusing
everything.

```env
# Or a hosted API
NATURALQUERY_LLM_DRIVER=gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here

NATURALQUERY_LLM_DRIVER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

NATURALQUERY_LLM_DRIVER=claude
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Built-in drivers: `ollama`, `gemini`, `openai`, `claude` - plus any
OpenAI-compatible service, below.

### Bring your own model - hosted or self-hosted

No model is fixed by this package. Every provider's model is set by you, and
**any service speaking the OpenAI chat-completions protocol plugs in without
code changes** - that covers DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, Together, OpenRouter,
and self-hosted stacks like vLLM, LM Studio, LocalAI, and llama.cpp server.

```env
# DeepSeek (config block ships ready-made)
NATURALQUERY_LLM_DRIVER=deepseek
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-chat

# Self-hosted (vLLM / LM Studio / LocalAI / llama.cpp - usually keyless)
NATURALQUERY_LLM_DRIVER=selfhosted
SELFHOSTED_LLM_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
SELFHOSTED_LLM_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:14b
```

For anything else, add your own block under `llm.providers` in
`config/naturalquery.php` with a `base_url` + `model`, then set
`NATURALQUERY_LLM_DRIVER=<your-block-name>`. That is the whole procedure —
here is Mistral, added exactly that way and verified end to end:

```php
// config/naturalquery.php → llm.providers
'mistral' => [
    'api_key'  => env('MISTRAL_API_KEY'),
    'model'    => env('MISTRAL_MODEL', 'mistral-large-latest'),
    'base_url' => env('MISTRAL_BASE_URL', 'https://api.mistral.ai/v1'),
    'force_json' => true,
],
```

```env
NATURALQUERY_LLM_DRIVER=mistral
MISTRAL_API_KEY=...
```

`naturalquery:doctor` then confirms the driver, the key and that the model is
live — and tells you precisely what is missing if the block is wrong.

Tip for self-hosted servers that reject OpenAI's `response_format` parameter:
set `force_json => false` in the block. Fully air-gapped deployments (government, healthcare) can pair a
self-hosted model with the privacy wall - nothing, not even schema, leaves
your network.

## Configuration

Publish the config:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=naturalquery-config
```

### Query Modes

```php
// config/naturalquery.php
'query_mode' => 'auto', // recommended
```

| Mode | How it works |
|---|---|
| `intent` | AI extracts intent, local SQL builder constructs query. Safest. |
| `sql_generation` | AI generates SQL directly from schema context. Most flexible. |
| `auto` | Tries intent first, falls back to sql_generation. Recommended. |

### Single-Schema Projects

If your project has only one dataset:

```env
NATURALQUERY_DEFAULT_DATASET=orders
```

All queries go to that dataset. No detection needed.

### Multi-dataset projects

With several schema files loaded — one dataset each — the package works out
which one a question is about. Routing is for the cases where the wording alone
is not a giveaway: map a word users say to the dataset that answers it.

```php
// config/naturalquery.php
'query_routing' => [
    'ticket'    => 'support_tickets',
    'churn'     => 'subscriptions',
    'revenue'   => 'orders',
],

'system_instructions' => "
    This app has 3 datasets.
    Support and helpdesk questions use support_tickets.
    Anything about plans, renewals or churn uses subscriptions.
    Sales and revenue questions use orders.
",
```

Routing picks the dataset a question *starts* from; it does not stop a query
from reaching other tables. If the tables are related, the answer can still span
them - see [Working with many tables](#working-with-many-tables).
