/**
 * Who may spend your API key.
 *
 * The package used to put `auth` in the default middleware, which is the right
 * instinct and the wrong mechanism. A fresh `laravel new` app has no auth
 * scaffolding and therefore no `login` route, so the first thing a new adopter
 * saw was not a login page but a 500:
 *
 *     RouteNotFoundException: Route [login] not defined
 *
 * -  on `/naturalquery/demo`, the page the README tells them to visit. The
 * package appeared broken when it was working exactly as configured.
 *
 * So this follows the pattern Telescope and Horizon use for the same problem: a
 * gate, with a default that makes the package usable the moment it is
 * installed and closed everywhere else.
 *
 *   - A `viewNaturalQuery` gate defined by the app decides, always.
 *   - No gate, local or testing   → allowed. A developer evaluating the
 *     package on their own machine should not have to build a login first,
 *     and their first feature test should not fail with 403.
 *   - No gate, anywhere else      → an authenticated user is required, which
 *     is what `auth` gave before, minus the crash.
 *
 * Define the gate as soon as it is more than you: these endpoints spend money
 * on every request, so an open one in production is an LLM proxy for the
 * internet.
 *
 *     Gate::define('viewNaturalQuery', fn ($user) => $user->isAdmin());
