/**
 * A ceiling on how many questions one person can ask in a day.
 *
 * `throttle:60,1` already ships on these routes, but a rate is not a budget:
 * sixty a minute sustained is around eighty-six thousand questions a day, and
 * every one of them is a paid API call. Rate limiting protects the server.
 * This protects the bill.
 *
 * It matters most in exactly the configuration people reach for first — the
 * widget on a public page with `auth` removed, where the visitor is anonymous
 * and the key is yours.
 *
 * Counted per authenticated user, or per IP when there is no user. The counter
 * lives in the cache and expires at the end of the day, so nothing needs
 * migrating and nothing needs cleaning up.
