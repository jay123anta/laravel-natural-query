 * A question could not be answered.

 * Separate from QuestionAnswered because the two want different treatment: a
 * failure is worth alerting on, and the pattern of failures is the best guide
 * to what a schema is missing. `errorCode` is the machine-readable one from
 * Engine\ErrorCode, so a listener can tell a provider outage worth paging
 * someone about from a question the schema simply cannot answer.
 *
 * Clarifications are NOT failures and do not fire this — being asked which
 * measure you meant is the system working.
