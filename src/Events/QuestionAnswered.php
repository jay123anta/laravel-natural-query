 * took. Enough to build a usage dashboard, a cost report per team, or a
 * "questions we answer badly" review queue, without patching the package.
 *
 * `rowCount` rather than the rows themselves, deliberately. A listener that
 * wanted the data can re-run the SQL; putting result rows on an event invites
 * them into log drivers, queue payloads and error trackers, which is the one
 * direction this package is built to keep data out of.
