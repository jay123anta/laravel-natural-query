 * security signal and belongs wherever an application sends those. Under
 * normal use it should essentially never fire: the model is asked for SELECT
 * statements against a whitelisted set of tables, so a rejection means either
 * a model producing something well outside its instructions, or someone
 * probing the endpoint.
 *
 * A handful in a day is noise. A burst from one user is not.
