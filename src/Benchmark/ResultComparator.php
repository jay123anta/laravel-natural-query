/**
 * Is this answer the same answer, allowing for the ways SQL differs?

 * Text-to-SQL is graded the way Spider and BIRD grade it: not by comparing
 * query strings, because many different queries are correct, but by running
 * the generated query and a hand-written reference against the same database
 * and comparing the RESULT SETS. A query is right when its answer is right.
 *
 * Extracted so the package's own benchmark and the adopter-facing
 * `naturalquery:benchmark` grade identically. Two implementations of "is this
 * the same result" would drift, and the number this package quotes about
 * itself has to mean the same thing as the number an adopter measures on their
 * own schema -  otherwise neither is worth stating.
