 * Why a query failed, in a form a client can branch on.

 * Every failure used to come back as `status: error` with an English sentence,
 * so a frontend deciding whether to retry, rephrase, or show a support link had
 * to match on prose that was rewritten three times in a week. These codes are
 * part of the API and will not change wording under anyone.
 *
 * The HTTP status each maps to is defined here too, so the controller cannot
 * drift from the codes and a caller that only reads the status line still gets
 * something truthful.
