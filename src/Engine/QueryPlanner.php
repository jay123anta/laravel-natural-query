/**
 * Decide whether a question needs more than one query, and if so, what they are.
 *
 * "Compare revenue this year with last year" is two queries and a subtraction.
 * Answered as one, it returns whichever half the model happened to write SQL
 * for, and the other half is silently missing — the same failure mode as a
 * dropped GROUP BY, with the same confident presentation.
 *
 * Planning costs an API call, so it is not run on every question. A local
 * pattern check gates it: questions with no sign of comparison or conjunction
 * go straight down the existing single-query path at exactly the cost they do
 * today. This keeps the common case free and, more importantly, keeps it
 * unchanged — a planner that fires on "top 5 customers" could only make that
 * worse.
 *
 * PRIVACY: the planning prompt contains the question and the dataset list.
 * No data values, in keeping with the rest of the package.

A user asked a question about their data. Decide whether answering it honestly
requires MORE THAN ONE database query.

USER QUESTION: "{$query}"

AVAILABLE DATASETS:
{$datasetList}

It needs several queries when it asks about two or more separate things — two
time periods, two named records, two datasets, or a total plus a breakdown.
It needs only ONE query when a single SELECT with GROUP BY, WHERE or ORDER BY
would answer it. "Revenue by region" is ONE query. "Revenue this year vs last
year" is TWO.

Rules:
- Each step must be a COMPLETE question that stands alone, with its own subject
  and its own filter. Never write "and the same for last year" — write
  "total revenue in 2025".
- Use the vocabulary of the datasets above.
- At most {$maxSteps} steps. Prefer fewer.
- If one query answers it, return an empty steps array.

Return JSON only (no markdown):
{
    "steps": ["first complete question", "second complete question"],
    "comparison": true,
    "explanation": "why it was split, briefly"
}

Set "comparison" to true only when the steps measure the SAME thing under
different conditions, so the numbers are meaningfully comparable.
