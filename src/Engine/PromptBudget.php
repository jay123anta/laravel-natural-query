/**
 * Prompt Budget
 *
 * NQ-001-REDUCE cut this down to a bare bound (the G1-round-3 ruling struck
 * out the scoping half entirely -  no seeding, no FK expansion, no per-question
 * SQL gate, no scope-filtered prompt). A pure function of a finished prompt
 * string and how many datasets were actually rendered into it -  no loop, no
 * shrinking, no provider knowledge. It answers exactly one question: does
 * this prompt fit inside `prompts.max_chars`?
 *
 * R4: the bound may only REFUSE. There is no second, smaller attempt in
 * here or anywhere downstream of it -  a refusal from `check()` is always
 * `_unretriable` at the call site, because the only retry strategy this
 * package has sends a SMALLER, single-dataset prompt, which is exactly the
 * wrong move for a refusal caused by size rather than by what the model
 * made of the question.
