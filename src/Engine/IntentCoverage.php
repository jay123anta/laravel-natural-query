/**
 * Does the intent contract have somewhere to put this question?
 *
 * Intent mode expresses a deliberately small slice of SQL: one measure, one
 * grouping, one name filter, one period, an order and a limit. That covers most
 * questions and is safer than free SQL generation — deterministic, no
 * hallucinated columns, no clause the validator has to catch.
 *
 * The danger is what happens at the edge. A question needing something the
 * contract cannot represent did not fail: the unrepresentable part was dropped
 * and the remainder answered, with no sign that a narrower question had been
 * substituted. Four defects of exactly that shape were found in three days —
 * a dropped GROUP BY, a dropped metric, a dropped clarification, a dropped
 * period — each fixed by widening the contract by one field.
 *
 * Widening it one field at a time never closes the gap; there is always
 * another clause. So this asks the opposite question: does the wording show
 * the question needs more than the contract holds? If so, route it to SQL
 * generation, which can express arbitrary (still validated, still SELECT-only)
 * SQL.
 *
 * Escalating is close to free — intent parsing and SQL generation are one API
 * call each — so a false positive costs nothing but determinism, while a false
 * negative is a confidently wrong number. The patterns lean towards escalating.
