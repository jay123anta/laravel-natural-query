/**
 * Suggest what to ask next.
 *
 * The hardest part of querying your own data in words is not phrasing a
 * question -  it is knowing which questions the data can answer at all. A chat
 * interface makes that worse, because an empty prompt offers no clue what
 * exists. Every answer therefore carries a few concrete follow-ups.
 *
 * These are derived from the schema and the query that was just answered, not
 * from the model: no extra API call, no latency, no cost, and they cannot
 * suggest a breakdown the validator would refuse -  the same groupable columns
 * that gate SQL generation gate these.
 *
 * PRIVACY (Rule 2): a suggestion is composed here and SENT TO A PROVIDER the
 * moment the user clicks it, so nothing derived from the result rows may
 * appear in one. Only column and dataset names -  schema structure -  are used.
 *
 * This class used to offer "Break West down by category", built from the top
 * row's value and carrying that value in the query it would send. It was
 * defended on the grounds that the click makes it the user's own query text.
 * That is the argument Rule 2 exists to reject: the string was composed by the
 * package out of data, and one click sent it. On a freshly discovered schema
 * the top row's value can be a `remember_token`, because introspection marks
 * every string column groupable and nothing here knew which columns hold
 * secrets. It was gated by `chat.suggest_drilldown_values`, and Rule 2 says
 * such a feature is rejected by design, not by configuration.
 *
 * Restoring the capability means executing a drill-down WITHOUT a provider -
 * the package already knows the dataset, metric, dimension and value, so no
 * natural language needs parsing. That is a feature, not a patch.
