 * Decides what a column is FOR, which drives everything downstream.

 * A "measure" is marked aggregatable, so the query builder sums it and the
 * model is told it is a number worth totalling. Getting this wrong is not
 * cosmetic: classifying `customer_id` as a measure tells the model to compute
 * the total of a foreign key, which is meaningless, and pushes it away from
 * the join that would have answered the question.
 *
 * Both introspectors used to carry their own copy of this and had already
 * drifted — the MySQL one did not treat TEXT columns as dimensions.
