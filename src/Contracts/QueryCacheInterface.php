 * Tier 2: Database with fuzzy matching for similar queries

     * Find a cached result for a query.
     *
     * Deliberately unchanged since 1.0.0. Dataset-aware lookup arrived in
     * 2.1.0 and lives in `ScopesCacheByDataset` instead of here, because
     * adding even an OPTIONAL parameter to an interface method is a fatal
     * error for every class already implementing the old signature -  the
     * app does not boot. A minor release cannot do that, and the package
     * already had the right precedent in `ReportsUsage`.
     *
     * THE SHAPE TO RETURN, which is what `store()` was given plus a little:
     *
     *   [
     *     'cached'           => true,
     *     'cache_match_type' => 'exact' | 'fuzzy',   // reported as metadata
     *     'intent'           => [...],               // EXACTLY what store() received
     *     'dataset'          => $intent['dataset'] ?? null,
     *   ]
     *
     * `intent` must come back byte-identical. The engine reads reserved keys
     * out of it that it never told you about -  `_sql_result` decides which
     * reader may replay the row, `_asking_scope` decides whether the row is
     * eligible for the question being asked at all -  and a row that has lost
     * them is not refused, it is silently misread: a filtered total answered
     * as an unfiltered one, or another dataset's number returned with
     * `success` and no API call. Store the array whole and hand it back whole.
     *
     * @param  string  $query  The natural language query
     * @return array|null Cached intent data in the shape above, or null
