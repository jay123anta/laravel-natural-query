/**
 * A provider that can say what its last call cost.
 *
 * Every provider API returns a usage block — Gemini's `usageMetadata`,
 * OpenAI's `usage` — and the package threw all of it away. That left an
 * adopter unable to answer the first question any finance or platform team
 * asks about an AI feature: what does it cost, and who is spending it?
 *
 * The daily budget counts QUESTIONS, which is a poor proxy. A question against
 * a two-table schema and one against a fourteen-table schema differ by an
 * order of magnitude in prompt tokens, and a decomposed multi-step question
 * costs several calls. Counting requests treats those as equal.
 *
 * Deliberately a SEPARATE interface rather than a method on
 * LlmProviderInterface: adding to that contract would break every custom
 * provider an adopter has already written, and Rule 3 asks for capabilities
 * that degrade gracefully. Callers check `instanceof` and carry on without
 * usage when a provider does not report it.
