 * What kind of turn is this?
 *
 * Decided explicitly and locally, before anything is resolved, because the
 * failure users actually notice is a NEW question treated as a refinement:
 * they ask about something unrelated and get results still filtered by a
 * region they mentioned three turns ago, with nothing on screen to explain it.
 *
 * So the bias runs toward `new_query`. A refinement misread as a new question
 * loses inherited context and the user simply says it again; a new question
 * misread as a refinement returns a confident wrong number.
 *
 * No API call. This runs on every turn and the cost of asking a model would be
 * paid on every turn too, for a decision that patterns make well.
