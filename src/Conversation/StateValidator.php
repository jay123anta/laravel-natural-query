 * Check every slot against the schema before any SQL is built from it.

 * does not exist or a breakdown that is not a dimension. Those must become a
 * question, never a query: a confidently wrong number is worse than "I am not
 * sure what you mean by that", and it is worse by a wide margin when the
 * number is going to be read as fact.
 *
 * Slots are resolved to their canonical schema names as a side effect, so
 * "sales" becomes `revenue` once and stays that way for the rest of the
