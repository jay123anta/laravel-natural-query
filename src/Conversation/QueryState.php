 * What the conversation currently means, as slots rather than sentences.
 *
 * A follow-up used to be resolved by rewriting it into a new sentence and
 * handing that back to the model. Every rewrite lost something — "only in West"
 * became "show only in West details in Orders" and the metric disappeared — and
 * every turn re-parsed the whole dialogue, so a misread early on propagated
 * unpredictably through the ones after it.
 *
 * The state is the thing that moves between turns now. The model resolves one
 * utterance against a compact structured summary; the merge happens here, in
 * PHP, where it is deterministic. That shrinks what the model reasons over to a
 * single instruction, and it makes "no, go back" a restore rather than another
 * interpretation.
