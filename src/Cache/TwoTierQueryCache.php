     * upgrade misses the old rows instead of serving them. Intents cached
     * before `group_by` existed answer "revenue by region" with the default
     * grouping; without this they would keep doing so until the TTL expired,
     * and the upgrade would look like it had changed nothing.
     *
     * 3 -  2.0.0 renamed the `scheme` slot to `dataset`. The stored intent is a
     * JSON blob, so the column rename does not touch what is inside it: a row
     * written by 1.0.0 still says "scheme". Served to 2.0.0 the dataset reads
     * null, and Tier 2 has no expiry, so every question asked before the
     * upgrade would have stayed broken until someone ran cache-cleanup.
     *
     * 4 -  2.1.0 added `_asking_scope`: the dataset the ASKING question was
     * scoped to, which is not the same thing as the dataset the answer turned
     * out to be about. A row written before this carries no scope at all, and
     * reading a missing scope as "unscoped" would make every pre-upgrade row
     * eligible for unscoped questions -  which is exactly the cross-dataset
     * hit this release exists to close. Missing it must mean unknown, and
     * unknown must miss.
     *
     * 5 -  2.2.1 stopped caching questions that resolve to a date. Rows
     * written by 2.2.0 and earlier carry those dates, and gating only the
     * WRITE left every one of them eligible on read: an install that already
     * had the stale-period bug kept serving it for ever, and upgrading did
     * not fix the installs that actually had it. Rows carry no expiry, so
     * retiring the contract is the only thing that reaches them.
