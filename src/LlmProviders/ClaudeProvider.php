     * One request shape for both calls, and two things it deliberately omits.
     *
     * The first live Claude call this package ever made returned 400 on every
     * question, for two reasons at once:
     *
     *   "`temperature` is deprecated for this model."
     *   "This model does not support assistant message prefill. The
     *    conversation must end with a user message."
     *
     * Both were sent on every request. The prefill was the older trick for
     * forcing JSON — send a trailing assistant turn containing "{" and glue it
     * back on afterwards — and current models refuse it outright. They also do
     * not need it: with "respond with valid JSON only" in the system prompt
     * they return clean JSON, and parseJsonResponse already strips code fences
     * and repairs the usual malformations.
     *
     * So neither is sent. Omitting both is valid on EVERY Claude model, old or
     * new, which is why there is no model sniffing here — a version check
     * would be one more thing to get wrong the next time the API moves.
     *
     * temperature can be set explicitly for a model that still honours it;
     * null, the default, leaves it out.
     *

Parse this natural language query about datasets: "{$text}"

AVAILABLE DATASETS:
{$datasetInfo}

Extract: dataset (dataset key), metric, limit (default 10), order (asc/desc), group_value (or null), group_by (or null), confidence (0.0-1.0).

When the user asks HOW MANY — "how many orders", "number of tickets", "orders by status" — the metric is record_count. Only pick a money or quantity metric when the user names one.

query_type: "aggregation" when the user wants ONE number for the whole dataset ("total revenue", "how many orders are there") with no breakdown and no named record; "ranking" for a list, which is the usual case; "group_detail" when they named one record.

filters: EVERY narrowing that applies, as [{"column":"region","value":"East"}]. This includes one stated in the question itself — "how many invoices are pending" is [{"column":"status","value":"pending"}], "sales in the West" is [{"column":"region","value":"West"}]. Match the value to the column it belongs to. In a conversation, also repeat the ones still in force — a filter you leave out is switched off.

filter_column: the column that group_value belongs to, when it is NOT the column being grouped by. "quantity by customer_name where product_category is Grocery" has group_by=customer_name, group_value=Grocery, filter_column=product_category. Leave null when the filter is on the grouping column itself.

group_by is the column to break results down by when the user asks for one — "revenue BY REGION", "orders PER STATUS". It must be one of that dataset's group_by columns; use null when no breakdown is named.

Periods are CALENDAR periods unless the user says otherwise: "this year" is 1 January to 31 December of the current year, "last year" the whole of the year before, "last month" the previous calendar month, "last quarter" the previous calendar quarter. Never a rolling window ending today — comparing a calendar year against a trailing twelve months puts overlapping data on both sides and the difference is meaningless.
date_from / date_to: if the user named a period — "last month", "in 2025", "since April" — resolve it to YYYY-MM-DD dates using TODAY'S DATE: {$today}. Both null when no period is mentioned. Never invent a period the user did not ask for.

If unclear, set needs_clarification=true with clarification_type="dataset" or "metric".
Never set needs_clarification for a HOW MANY question. Every dataset has record_count, so "how many X are there" is always answerable without asking.
If the user asks for a breakdown that is NOT in that dataset's group_by list, set needs_clarification=true and clarification_type="ambiguous" — never fall back to the default breakdown.

Return JSON only: {"dataset":"key","metric":"name","limit":10,"order":"desc","query_type":"ranking","group_value":null,"filter_column":null,"filters":[],"group_by":null,"date_from":null,"date_to":null,"confidence":0.85,"needs_clarification":false,"clarification_type":null}
