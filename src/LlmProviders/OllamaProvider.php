     * Three, not the usual four, and the difference is the safety margin. Two
     * reasons, both pointing the same way:
     *
     * English prose runs about four characters per token, but a schema prompt
     * is mostly short identifiers, types and punctuation, which tokenize worse
     * — nearer three and a half. Assuming four would leave no headroom on
     * exactly the content this prompt is made of.
     *
     * And this counts BYTES, not characters. A Devanagari or CJK character in
     * a schema description is three bytes and still costs roughly one token,
     * so bytes/4 would under-count it by about a third. At bytes/3 that case
     * lands near one token per character, which is about right.
     *
     * Erring low here means sending a prompt that gets silently truncated,
     * which is the bug this guard exists to stop. Erring high means refusing a
     * prompt that would have fitted, and saying exactly which setting to
     * raise. The second is the one to prefer.

query_type = "aggregation" for one number over the whole dataset ("total revenue", "how many orders"), else "ranking".
filters = EVERY narrowing, as [{"column":..,"value":..}] — including one stated in the question: "how many invoices are pending" is [{"column":"status","value":"pending"}]. In a conversation repeat the ones still in force; omitting one switches it off.
filter_column = the column group_value belongs to when it is not the grouping column ("by customer_name where product_category is Grocery").
group_by = the column to break results down by if the user asked ("revenue BY REGION"), from that dataset's group_by list, else null.
Never ask for clarification on a HOW MANY question — record_count always exists.
metric = record_count when the user asks HOW MANY ("how many orders", "orders by status"), otherwise the named measure.
Periods are CALENDAR periods unless the user says otherwise: "this year" is 1 January to 31 December of the current year, "last year" the whole of the year before, "last month" the previous calendar month, "last quarter" the previous calendar quarter. Never a rolling window ending today — comparing a calendar year against a trailing twelve months puts overlapping data on both sides and the difference is meaningless.
date_from / date_to = YYYY-MM-DD dates if the user named a period ("last month", "in 2025"), else null. TODAY IS {$today}.
