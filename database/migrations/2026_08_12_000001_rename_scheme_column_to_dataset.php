/**
 * 2.0.0 renamed "scheme" to "dataset" throughout, including these two columns.
 *
 * The create migrations were updated in place, so a fresh install already
 * arrives with `dataset` and every step here is a no-op — hence the guards.
 * This exists for installs made against 1.0.0, where the tables carry `scheme`
 * and the 2.0.0 code would query a column that is not there.
 *
 * Renaming rather than dropping keeps the cached queries and, more to the
 * point, the corrections a user took the trouble to submit.
 *
 * The indexes need explicit attention. `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN` moves an
 * index onto the new column but leaves its NAME alone, on every engine — so an
 * upgraded install would keep `..._scheme_index` while a fresh one has
 * `..._dataset_index`. The two populations would then be indistinguishable from
 * code, and the first future migration to write `dropIndex(['dataset', ...])`
 * would resolve the conventional name, succeed on fresh installs and fail on
 * upgraded ones, in production, at migrate time.
