/**
 * A question set for `php artisan naturalquery:benchmark`.
 *
 * Copy this to config/naturalquery-benchmark.php and rewrite it for your own
 * database. Fifteen to twenty questions is enough to be useful; the point is a
 * number you produced yourself rather than one this package asserts.
 *
 * HOW IT IS GRADED
 *
 * Not by comparing SQL — many different queries are correct. Your reference
 * query and the one the package generates are both run against your database
 * and the RESULT SETS are compared. Column names and column order are ignored.
 * Row order is ignored unless you set `ordered`, because a ranking's order is
 * its answer.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THAT MATTERS
 *
 * Write the reference SQL from the QUESTION, before you look at what the
 * package produced. Writing it afterwards means copying whatever it did,
 * including its mistakes, and the benchmark then marks its own homework and
 * reports 100% forever.
 *
 * WHAT TO INCLUDE
 *
 * Real questions your users ask, not questions you know it handles. Include
 * the awkward ones: two measures that could both be "revenue", a period
 * ("last quarter"), a filter and a grouping together. Those are where a
 * schema's missing descriptions show up.
 *
 * Running this calls your AI provider once or more per question, so it costs
 * money. Nothing runs it implicitly.
